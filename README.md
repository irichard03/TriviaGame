Bruce Campbell fan trivia Game.

Doesn't work, turning in what I have.

I had the timer working so questions would time out and autoswitch to next question, after 5 questions shows results, but I broke this trying to fix an issue I've been chasing all day.

There are three ways to switch a question:

Time runs out (works)

Wrong answer is clicked. (doesn't work, it may cycle through a couple questions, but stop working and an alert will pop up, if you click ok enough times it will give results...but they are wrong too, something is looping out of control.

Right aswer is clicked. (doesn't work, same as above).

I have been chasing "Cannot read property 'question' of undefined" errors all day. I think it occurs because I'm looping out of my array, but I'm going cross eyed looking at my code at this point.
